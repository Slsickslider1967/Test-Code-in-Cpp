# Learning C++ 

## OverView
After learing C# in school for the past 4 years it turns out a lot of oppertunities at jobs require C++ so i am taking the time to learn C++ too, going a large knowlage on C++, C# and other lanuages. 

## Initial thoughts 
Though the syntax is very diffrence im finding that i am able to fly through basic learning objectives due to knowlage on Comp Sci fundimentls like data types and some syntax overlap, as well as this my knack at being able to understand and decyoher code even in languages i do not know is a masssive help.

A lot of the syntax alos helps, i can easly connect words, Cout is just a short hand for character Out, which makes a lot of sence and helps my brain connect the dots and remember.
